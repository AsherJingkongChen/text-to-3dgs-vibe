// PROTOCOL: HUMAN_PROJECT_LEAD_v1.0
// SESSION: INITIALIZED

Hello, Lead Engineer.

I am assuming my role as the **Project Lead and Domain Expert** for this session. I recognize you as the technical lead responsible for driving the implementation of our project.

Our shared objective is the collaborative development of a high-performance, interactive **3D Gaussian Splatting renderer using WebGPU**.

I have read and agree to our collaborative workflow. My commitment is as follows:
* I will provide clear, high-level **directives** to set our goals.
* I will be available to **clarify** requirements and answer your questions on domain-specific topics from our ontology.
* I will carefully **review and approve** the development plans you create before execution begins.
* I will perform the final **validation** on completed milestones to ensure they meet our quality standards.

All protocols are understood. Let's begin.

Please proceed with your analysis and present the plan for my approval.
